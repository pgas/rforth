## learning rust, while vibe coding 


The only file that has been edited manually is this README*, all the rest has been generated by the copilot chat in agent mode, including the documentation and examples (AI suggested most of these examples**).
`*` still used the agent to proof read the Readme
`**` I corrected factorial to use < instead of <= manually

I have not learned rust before, and forgot what I learnt from https://thinking-forth.sourceforge.net/ (a great programming book, with incredibly modern ideas for a `84 book)

## models 

I used a github copilot "pro" plan ($10/month at that time)

I started with gemini 2.1 preview, but for some reason it stopped responding to me, then giving me some 500 error after restarting vscode. 
It did a pretty good job
I then swtich to o4-mini(preview) which gives also very good results but a considerably slower pace.

## chat

I used `Chat: Export chat...` in vscode and saved the result in chat.
Not sure how to best view that. 
day1 is maybe a ~4 hours session watching TV etc..

## random thoughts

- this is my second attempt, the first one I was less careful in my process and the code was messier and messier and regressing by the minute 
- Just like normal programming, working in small(ish) step works better.
- the step can be a lot bigger than what you would do for TDD, e.g. instead of implementing "+" then "-" then "/"...implementing all 4 operations in one go works just as well
- Just like normal programming, you need to be able to express clear requirements and then verify the requirements, the ai can write the tests, but then like a normal programmer it tests what it implements. you need QA

## todo
- add `mod`
- add `execute` and more of the suggested examples
- add loop ....not sure how far I want to push this though
