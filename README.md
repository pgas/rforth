## learning rust, while vibe coding 


The only file that has been edited manually is this README*, all the rest has been generated by the copilot chat in agent mode, including the documentation.
* still used the agent to proof read the Readme

I used a github copilot "pro" plan ($10/month at that time)

I started with gemini 2.1 preview, but for some reason it stopped responding to me, then giving me some 500 error after restarting vscode. 
It did a pretty good job
I then swtich to o4-mini(preview) which gives also very good results but a considerably slower pace.


## random thoughts
- this is my second attempt, the first one I was less careful in my process and the code was messier and messier and regressing by the minute 
- Just like normal programming, working in small(ish) step works better.
- the step can be a lot bigger than what you would do for TDD, e.g. instead of implementing "+" then "-" then "/"...implementing all 4 operations in one go works just as well
- Just like normal programming, you need to be able to express clear requirements and then verify the requirements, the ai can write the tests, but then like a normal programmer it tests what it implements. you need QA
