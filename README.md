## learning rust, while vibe coding 

I started with gemini 2.1 preview, but for some reason it stopped responding to me, then giving me some 500 error after restarting vscode. 
It did a pretty good job
I then swtich to o4-mini(preview) which gives also very good results but a considerably slower pace.
